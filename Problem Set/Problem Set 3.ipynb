    "For the following parts, a correct numerical answer will only earn credit if accompanied by\n",

    "**(a)** Use the Pulverizer to find integers s and t such that 135s + 59t = gcd(135, 59).  \n",
    "**(b)** Use the previous part to find the inverse of 59 modulo 135 in the range {1, . . . , 134}.  \n",
    "**(c)** Use Euler’s theorem to find the inverse of 17 modulo 31 in the range {1, . . . , 30}.  \n",
    "**(d)** Find the remainder of $34^82248$ divided by 83. (Hint: Euler’s theorem.)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Answer\n",
    "**(a)** By Pulverizer, we know that $$gcd(135,59) = gcd(59,rem(135,59)) = gcd(59,17)$$ $$\\Rightarrow\\  = gcd(17,8) = gcd(8,1) = 1$$  \n",
    "During the process, we can get following equation $$17 = 135-2\\cdot 59\\mid\\   8 = 59-3\\cdot 17\\mid\\   1 = 17-2\\cdot 8$$  \n",
    "Thus, we can express 1 with 135 and 59: $$gcd(135,59) = 1 = 7\\cdot 135+(-16)\\cdot 59$$, where $s = 7\\ and\\ t = -16$  \n",
    "**(b)** From the above equation we know that $-16\\cdot 59\\equiv 1(mod 135)$, so $-16$ is an inverse of 59 modulo 135. But what we need is an interger ranging from 1 to 134. So $$\\because 135\\cdot 59 -59\\cdot 135 = 0$$ $$\\therefore (7-59)\\cdot135 + (-16+135)\\cdot 59 = 1$$\n",
    "$$\\Rightarrow\\  \\ \\ 119\\cdot 59\\equiv 1(mod\\ 135)$$\n",
    "Therefore, the inverse of 59 modulo 135 ranging from 1 to 134 is *119*  \n",
    "**(c)** Obviously, 31 and 17 are both primes. According to Euler's Theorem, $17^{\\phi(31)}\\equiv 1(mod\\ 31)$.  \n",
    "Apparently, $7^{\\phi(31)-1}$ is the inverse of 17 modulo 31. $$\\because 31\\  is\\ prime\\Rightarrow \\phi(31) = 31-1=30$$ $$\\because 7^{29}\\equiv 11(mod\\ 31)$$ $$\\therefore 11\\times17\\equiv1(mod\\ 31)$$  \n",
    "Therefore, 11 is the inverse of 17 modulo 31 in the range {1, . . . , 30}.  \n",
    "**(d)** We can use the defination of modulo that $$34^{82248}\\equiv rem(34^{82248},83)(mod\\ 83)$$\n",
    "According to Euler's Theorem: $$34^{\\phi(83)}\\equiv1(mod\\ 83),\\ \\phi(83) = 82$$ $$\\because 82248 = 1003\\cdot82+2$$ \n",
    "$$\\because 34^2\\equiv 77 (mod\\ 83)$$ $$\\therefore 34^{82248} = (34^{82})^{1003}\\cdot 34^2\\equiv 1^{1003}\\cdot 77(mod\\ 83) = 77(mod\\ 83)$$\n",
    "$$\\therefore rem(34^{82248},83) = 77$$"
