    "Define a *3-chain* to be a (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence\n",
    "of three integers, which is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing. We\n",

    "the sequence as a1, a2, a3, a4, a5. Note that a monotonically increasing sequences is one in\n",

    "**(c)** Assuming that $a_1<a_2$ and $a_3 < a_4 < a_2$， show that any value of $a_5$ must result in a *3-chain*.  \n",

    "  \n",
    "## Answer\n",
    "**(a)** *solution*: Since $a_1<a_2$, if no *3-chain* occurs, the following inequation must holds $a_3,a_4,a_5<a_2$, or $a_1,a_2,a_{3/4/5}$ is a *3-chain*. Similarly, $a_4>a_3$ must holds, or $a_2,a_3,a_4$ forms a *3-chain*. If $a_3>a_1$, then $a_1,a_3,a_4$ forms a *3-chain*. So, $$a_3<a_1 $$$$ Q.E.D.$$   \n",
    "**(b)** *solution*: As we have already proved in **(a)**, $a_3,a_4,a_5<a_2$ and $a_4>a_3$ holds. We can combine those two inequations and get $a_3 < a_4 < a_2$. $$Q.E.D.$$  \n",

    "*solution*: If $a_5<a_4$, then $a_2,a_4,a_5$ forms a *3-chain*, so $a_5>a_4$must holds. Then $a_3 < a_4 < a_5$ holds and forms a *3-chain*. So, whatever $a_5$ is, a *3-chain* forms.$$Q.E.D.$$  \n",
    "**(d)** *solution*: Similarly, we can prove that if $a_1>a_2$ also always form a *3-chain* by substituting $<$ with $>$. Thereby, since $a_1\\not= a_2$, one of the two conditions ($a_1<a_2 or a_1>a_2$) must holds and a *3-chain* is formed.$$Q.E.D.$$"
